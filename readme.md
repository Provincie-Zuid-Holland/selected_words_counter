# Selected Words Counter

This code searches various file formats in a directory for selected words from a word list and outputs the results in an Excel file.

It first converts different file formats into .txt files for easier searching.

Then, it generates an Excel file with all the selected words as columns, showing the count of occurrences for each word, with each row representing a file.

## Instruction for running
1. Alter the config.py parameters for your environment.
2. Run the main.py file.
